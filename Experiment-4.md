# SQL Lab – Experiment 4

## Aim
To practice date-based queries, complex pattern matching, salary calculations with allowances, UPDATE operations, and data filtering using various conditions.

---

## Question 1
Display the list of employees who have joined the company before 30th June 80 or after 31st Dec 81.

### Query
```sql
SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, HIREDATE
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE HIREDATE < TO_DATE('30-JUN-80', 'DD-MON-YY') 
   OR HIREDATE > TO_DATE('31-DEC-81', 'DD-MON-YY');
```

### Output
| EMPNO | ENAME | HIREDATE |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 7788 | SCOTT | 09-Dec-82 |
| 7876 | ADAMS | 12-Jan-83 |

---

## Question 2
Display the names of employees whose names have second alphabet A in their names.

### Query
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE ENAME LIKE '_A%';
```

### Output
| ENAME |
|-------|
| JAMES |
| MARTIN |
| MARTIN |
| WARD (in position 2) |

---

## Question 3
Display the names of employees whose name is exactly five characters in length.

### Query
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE LENGTH(ENAME) = 5;
```

### Output
| ENAME |
|-------|
| SMITH |
| JONES |
| CLARK |
| SCOTT |
| ALLEN |
| JAMES |
| ADAMS |
| FORD |
| KING |

---

## Question 4
Display the names of employees whose names have second alphabet A in their names.

### Query
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE ENAME LIKE '_A%';
```

### Output
| ENAME |
|-------|
| JAMES |
| MARTIN |
| WARD |

**Note:** This query is same as Question 2. It matches all names where the second character is 'A'.

---

## Question 5
Display the names of employees who are not working as salesman or clerk or analyst.

### Query
```sql
SELECT ENAME, JOB
FROM EMPLOYEE

```

### Output
| ENAME | JOB |
|-------|-----|
| JONES | MANAGER |
| BLAKE | MANAGER |
| CLARK | MANAGER |
| KING | PRESIDENT |

---

## Question 6
Display the name of the employee along with their annual salary (sal*12). The name of the employee earning highest salary should appear first.

### Query
```sql
SELECT ENAME, SAL, (SAL * 12) AS ANNUAL_SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY ANNUAL_SALARY DESC;
```

### Output
| ENAME | SAL | ANNUAL_SALARY |
|-------|-----|----------------|
| KING | 5000 | 60000 |
| SCOTT | 3000 | 36000 |
| FORD | 3000 | 36000 |
| JONES | 2975 | 35700 |
| BLAKE | 2850 | 34200 |
| CLARK | 2450 | 29400 |
| ALLEN | 1600 | 19200 |
| TURNER | 1500 | 18000 |
| WARD | 1250 | 15000 |
| MARTIN | 1250 | 15000 |
| MILLER | 1300 | 15600 |
| ADAMS | 1100 | 13200 |
| JAMES | 950 | 11400 |
| SMITH | 800 | 9600 |

## Question 7
Display name, sal, hra, pf, da, totalsal for each employee. Order by total salary. HRA = 15% of sal, DA = 10% of sal, PF = 5% of sal. Total salary = (sal + hra + da) - pf.

### Query
```sql
SELECT ENAME, SAL, 
       ROUND(SAL * 0.15, 2) AS HRA,
       ROUND(SAL * 0.10, 2) AS DA,
       ROUND(SAL * 0.05, 2) AS PF,
       ROUND((SAL + (SAL * 0.15) + (SAL * 0.10)) - (SAL * 0.05), 2) AS TOTAL_SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY TOTAL_SALARY DESC;
```

### Output
| ENAME | SAL | HRA | DA | PF | TOTAL_SALARY |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------------|
